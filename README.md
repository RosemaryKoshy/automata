# automata
Cellular automata: Compute cellular automata and print then to terminal or write to .png file. I recommend editing the resulting images using GIMP. Note that large files >=4096px may not display.
# Additional Notes
pip install Pillow
(not PIL)
LENGTH must be a power of two for np.sum(colors) to zero-out
Code should be edited if display in terminal is desired
