# Cellular automata
Compute cellular automata and print then to terminal or write to .png file.

I recommend editing the resulting images using GIMP.

Note that large files >=4096px may not display.
# Additional Notes
Run the command below to install Pillow
```$ pip install Pillow # (not PIL).```

LENGTH must be a power of two for np.sum(colors) to zero-out.

Code should be edited if display in terminal is desired.
